A handbook outlining the lessons learned when starting a new project

## 1. Requirement Gathering

You need to figure out and write down what you want to achieve. *The project goal is the higest-level requirement!*
For example, I would like to create a tool to help people start software projects.

There are technical books covering languages, systems, and techniques, but very few which document how to start a project.

### Talking with stackholders

* Stakeholders are the people driving the project.
* Stakeholders define the vision and capabilities of the project.

    * These are the people who pay for the project
      * via monetary means
      * via time and effort.
  * End-Users
    * The people who will interact with the software
  * Consultants/Subject Matter Experts
    * Experts in the field this software deals with 
  * Development Team
    * This includes programmers and managers 
  * Governments
    * Governments might have made laws which a software must follow. 
  * 3rd Systems the software interfaces with
    * Any thirdparty system your software interacts with has rules and limits.
      * request/second
